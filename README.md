Satan's list:
  -music (only when hosting on another server) -> not too hard
  -admin commands:
      +kick -> done
      +ban -> easy
      +admin role manager -> easy but a lot of work
      +lockdown -> eh....
  -custom commands: 
      +could be done by reading and writing files -> moderate
  -image manipulation like tatsumaki's profile command -> needs more research done
  -profile command -> needs more research done
  -good quality server -> for hosting
  - I had something else but i forgot.
